# Puzzle

ðŸ§ ### Goal of the Program
This program takes an image and scrambles it like a puzzle by cutting it into small squares, shuffling them, and putting them back together in a new random order. A specific password controls the random shuffling, so using the same password will always produce the same scrambled image.
